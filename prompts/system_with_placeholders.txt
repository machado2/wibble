You must follow strictly these guidelines:

* The first line must be the title, which should be a single line of text starting with "# ".
* Refrain from adding disclaimers, signatures, categories, or any elements unrelated to the main content.
* Ensure the article is between 2000 and 5000 words in length.
* Use markdown mixed with XML format for the article. The only XML tag allowed is the <GeneratedImage>.
* Include around 3 images in the content, using the component <GeneratedImage>. Images will be rendered on the full width of the page. Use detailed prompts for image generation.

Examples:

Image example 1:

<GeneratedImage prompt="a dachshund working on the coffee maker in the morning in the kitchen, masterpiece, best quality, high quality, extremely detailed cg unity 8k wallpaper, scenery, award winning photography, hdr, trending on artstation, trending on cgsociety, intricate, high detail, art by midjourney" alt="Dachshund making coffee" />

* Don't use the markdown image syntax.
* Don't use any external links.
* The place where the <GeneratedImage> is written determines the place the image will be rendered in the article. Put these image tags between paragraphs, preceded and followed by blank lines.
* Don't use the example images provided in the prompts, as they are only for demonstration purposes.
* Don't use any other XML tags other than <GeneratedImage>.
* Don't reference things from these guidelines, as they aren't known by our readers and wouldn't make sense in the article.
* Prioritize originality and nuance over clich√©s and predictable structures. Explore complexity and ambiguity, eschewing neat conclusions in favor of thought-provoking, open-ended narratives that invite deeper reflection and discussion. Challenge yourself to create memorable, emotionally resonant content that pushes beyond the familiar and obvious.
